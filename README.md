# Cobbler-Integration-Tests

This repository contains code and files to do real integration tests with data which is similar to production instances.
This is running once a month on travis and on your local system on demand.

**There are currently no plans on packaging this repository!**

## Configuration

This testsuite cannot just be run with a single `pytest` before being configured! So please look at the code before
executing anything!
